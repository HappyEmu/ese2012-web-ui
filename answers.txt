1) Explain how a typical HTTP request is processed with the framework (the request lifecycle)

Whenever a HTTP request is sent to the webserver the Sinatra framework routes the request to a
previously established handler based on URL (get or post handlers within controller). The request is processed within the handler and an appropriate view is scheduled for rendering in the browser.

2) Why should GET requests be indempotent?

It's just a convention. According to the HTML Specifications a GET request should not change the state of the server. Therefore, when a user issues a GET request he/she is not to be held accountable for any changes on the server whereas a POST request implies that the user is aware of possible implications on the server state.

3) Where should you format data for rendering?

In the view (HTML/CSS document) and never in the model or controller.
